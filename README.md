# battle-tank-game

Using art assets provided by Unity, I have made a Battle Tank game. <br>
I have learned and used various game programming patterns like: <br>
Singleton Pattern, State Design pattern for implementing different enemy States, Observer Pattern for adding an achievement System, Object Pooling for using Bullets in the game, and async await.
